	<h3>A Game of Volleyball and a Joke</h3>
	<p>It all started with in high school with a game of volleyball. It was sophomore class gym, and (fortunately) there were four of us in the same class. It was the volleyball unit, and we all formed a team. Since I was part Russian and everyone else more left leaning than right, the group of nerds that we were formed the Soviet Union Team. Amongst the chaos of raining volleyballs on the other team, we made several communist jokes, one of them being the Daily Ration. To that I commented, "That sounds like a newspaper." I thought it ended there. Later, however, the same team members presented me with what was the original Daily Ration. And thus, the Daily Ration was born.</p>
	<h3>Volume 1: Trial by Fire</h3>
	<p>With the first edition released, several things happened. For one, the design became vastly different. Even the first edition of the first volume got changed. Secondly, we began to set up base in a Discord server known as Pi Nation. At the time, Pi Nation was our only audience and it only made sense to do so. Finally, our team expanded. We had a large amount of writers on this project and things got done. At the end of the first volume, we released a holiday magazine, and the prospects looked promising.</p>
	<h3>Volume 2: The Sequel Cut Short</h3>
	<p>At the beginning of volume 2, the paper went through another revision in design, but the team came back ready to continue the paper. We wrote and things continued onwards as usual. Then the leak happened. The school found out through their language software, and one of our editors got called in. He received nothing, but the event left a bad memory, and at his request, the paper stopped production.</p>
	<h3>Hiatus</h3>
	<p>A massive time frame was left. Much of the team still stayed as friends, but no one thought of bringing back the project. After all, the news we had to share spread faster through Discord anyway. Unfortunately, the server we were based in collapsed and the base was lost. And as such, time passed on without a second thought.</p>
	<h3>Rebirth</h3>
	<p>Around the start of the year, nine months after the COVID pandemic started, I (the original member narrating this story) was looking through some files and found a folder of the old copies. Having been in search of some way to vent and let out pain that had built up over the time, I decided to reread some of them. In the end, I reread all of them, and decided a bold move: I would bring the Daily Ration back, even if I had to do it by myself. And so in February that year, in a new server that held most of the old audience, I released Edition 1 of Volume 3.</p>
	<h3>Volume 3: Continuation</h3>
	<p>As of now, volume 3 has had success. Though the audience has decreased in size and the workload amped up for one person, the Daily Ration has found a new home and purpose. Many would call this endeavor folly. To them, I say that even if the world was against you, the dream would live as long as you believed in it with every fiber of your body. As such, the paper went through a few design changes throughout the time, making it more useful than before. As of now, this is where the story lies: with hope for the future, and the Daily Ration still living on.</p>
